# Scalable-Database-Systems

A parcel delivery company wishes to build a system to track its vehicles and drivers throughout the working day, i.e. from 8.00 am to 4:00 pm. 
The company has fitted each of its vehicles with a GPS tracking device which will send the data to a database hosted on a cloud system.
My task was to design and implement a MySQL database schema to be used to store relevant data from these GPS devices. At the start of any dayâ€™s work drivers use whatever vehicle is assigned to them by the company. Drivers work on shift basis so a morning shift is from 8:00 am to 11:55 am and an afternoon shift is from 12:00 noon to 4:00 pm.

I have also included a report in which I show the process I undertook in designing the database. I also describe in more detail,  the queries and procedures I wrote to meet certain task requirements.
